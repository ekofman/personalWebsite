		I started playing classical guitar as a kid -- lots of Spanish tunes -- and moved into folk and rock when I decided
		my long term goal was to become a rock star. Who knows if that will happen, but in any case, I decided to start writing some of my
		own songs during my Freshman year in college, and began performing them at the campus coffee shop to test the waters. Eventually
		I was lucky enough to be part of two fun rock bands, Edgy Demeanor (formerly known as The Snap) and The Percs, and wrote several songs
		for these groups. I'd say my musical muses are The Doors and Boston. Take a listen and get your boogie on.
